### Story
During High School, Massimo Biagioni was always a woman's best friend. He used to go over to girls' homes and started to try picking them up. If successful, he made their siblings cook him some spaghetti. Furthermore, he used to lend them his pants so the can try to do sexual things in them.

### Overview
During the development of The Roach App, we've always wanted to provide quality content to our consumers. We've decided to start using the beauty of Google's newest User Interface, Material Design. Below you will find some screenshots of The Roach App.

We have always wanted to provide the simplest home page so our users did not get overwhelmed with information on the first screen. Because of this mentality, we've opted to leave the home page blank. You're welcome.

Below, we've showcased the beauty of our trailer section.
